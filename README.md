# Jimara

Jimara will be a simplistic game engine initially built for my own projects, as well as educational purposes.

Initiall incarnation of the project will come with Windows and Linux support, MAC will be comming later; Consoles may or may not come and if they do, due to likely NDA-s, they'll likely be tucked away somewhere on a private branch or something anyway...

README will be updated as we go further and the project evolves beyond the starter code :).
